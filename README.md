This is a chatting robot based on IBM Watson Assistant API, which provides financial advice. The user answer the questions by typing answer in the input bar at the bottom. The robot provide the portfolio suitable for the user based on user's answers to a series of questions. Different optimization strategies apply based on the user's extent of risk aversion.
